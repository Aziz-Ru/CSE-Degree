# What is the purpose of the cookie-parser middleware in Express.js?

cookie-parser is middleware that simplifies handling cookies. It parses incoming cookies from client requests and makes them accessible in the req.cookies object. This makes it easier to read and manipulate cookies in your Express JS application without manual parsing.

- Cookie Parsing: Automatically parses cookies attached to incoming HTTP requests.

-Access to Cookies: Provides access to cookies sent by clients in the HTTP request

- headers.
  Cookie Management: Facilitates easy manipulation of cookies within ExpressJS applications, including setting, updating, and clearing cookies.
  Session Management: Often used in conjunction with session management middleware to handle user sessions, storing and retrieving session-related data stored in cookies.
- Security: Enhances security by allowing validation and verification of cookies received from clients to ensure they havenâ€™t been tampered with.
- Integration: Seamlessly integrates with ExpressJS applications, requiring minimal configuration.
- Middleware Stack: Can be included in the middleware stack using the app.use() method, making it available to handle cookie-related tasks for all incoming requests.
