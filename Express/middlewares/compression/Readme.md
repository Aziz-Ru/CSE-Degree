## What is the purpose of the compression middleware in Express JS ?

- Reduces Data Transfer: Compression middleware reduces the size of HTTP responses sent from your ExpressJS server to clients, such as web browsers or mobile devices

- Improves Performance: By compressing HTTP responses, the middleware decreases the amount of data transferred over the network, leading to faster load times for web pages and improved performance for web applications.

- Bandwidth Optimization: Compressing responses reduces the amount of bandwidth used by your server, making it more efficient, especially for serving large files or resources like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

- Supported Compression Algorithms: The compression middleware supports various compression algorithms, such as gzip and deflate, allowing clients that support these algorithms to receive compressed responses.
