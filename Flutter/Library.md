# Dart's core libraries
Dart has a rich set of core libraries that provide essentials for many everyday programming tasks such as working on collections of objects (dart:collection), making calculations (dart:math), and encoding/decoding data (dart:convert). 

## dart:core

  Built-in types, collections, and other core functionality. This library is automatically imported into every Dart program.
## dart:async
  Support for asynchronous programming, with classes such as Future and Stream.
## dart:math
  Mathematical constants and functions, plus a random number generator.
## dart:convert
  Encoders and decoders for converting between different data representations, including JSON and UTF-8.
## dart:io
  I/O for programs that can use the Dart VM, including Flutter apps, servers, and command-line scripts.
## dart:html
  DOM and other APIs for browser-based apps.
