# Asynchronous programming: futures, async, await

Asynchronous operations let your program complete work while waiting for another operation to finish. Here are some common asynchronous operations:

  -Fetching data over a network.
  -Writing to a database.
  -Reading data from a file.
  asynchronous computations usually provide their result as a Future or, if the result has multiple parts, as a Stream. These computations introduce asynchrony into a program.
