### var
In Dart, var is a keyword that represents a dynamically typed variable. 

### Null safety
Null safety prevents an error that results from unintentional access of variables set to null. The error is called a null dereference error. A null dereference error occurs when you access a property or call a method on an expression that evaluates to null. you can control whether the type allows null. To enable nullability, you add a ? to the end of the type declaration.For example `String? Name`
