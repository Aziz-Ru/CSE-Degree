# Communication & Computer Network

Data communications refers to the transmission of this digital data between two or more computers and a computer network or data network is a telecommunications network that allows computers to exchange data. The physical connection between networked computing devices is established using either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet.


### Applications of Communication & Computer Network
Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network.They provide numerous advantages:

- Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices
- Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP
- Information sharing by using Web or Internet
- Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages
- IP phones
- Video conferences
- Parallel computing
- Instant messaging

##  Computer Network
A computer network is a collection of computing devices that are connected with each other for the purpose of information and resource sharing among a wide variety of users.

- Sharing − Computer networks enable sharing of files, software, hardware resources and computing capabilities.
- Speed: The communication speed among the components is fast enough to be comparable with a centralized system.
- Scalability − Sizes of computer networks dynamically increase with time. The networks have to be scalable so that they can evolve adequately for future deployments.
- Integration − All the components of the network work in a coordinated manner for a seamless user experience.
- Security − Networks allow security and access rights to the users for restricted sharing of resources and information.
- Cost Effectiveness − Networking reduces the deployment cost of hardware and software of a centralized system.

## Classification of Computer Networks
Computer networks are classified based on various factors.They includes:

- Geographical span
- Inter-connectivity
- Administration
- Architecture

## Elements of a Computer Network

1. Sender:The computer wants to give a message to some mainframe or computers.

2. Receiver:The computer takes the data from the sender who wishes to communicate.

3. Communication Medium:It is the medium over which the sender connects to the receiver. It can be used if the distance between sender and receiver is less, or it can be wireless if the distance between sender and receiver is much more.

4. Protocols:It is a set of rules which the sender and receiver will follow.

## Types of Computer Networks
- Personal Area Network (PAN): A small network used for communication between personal devices like phones, laptops, and tablets.
- Local Area Network (LAN): A network that connects computers within a small area, such as a home, office, or building.
- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): A LAN that uses wireless technology, like Wi-Fi, to connect devices.
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A network that spans a city or a large campus, connecting multiple LANs.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): A network that covers a large geographical area, often connecting multiple MANs or LANs.
- Campus Area Network (CAN): A network that connects multiple LANs within a limited area, such as a university or corporate campus.
- Storage Area Network (SAN): A high-speed network that provides access to consolidated storage devices.
- System Area Network: A network used to connect high-performance computers in a data center or cluster.
- Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN): A point-to-multipoint LAN architecture using fiber optics to reduce costs and infrastructure.
- Enterprise Private Network (EPN): A private network used by businesses to securely connect their multiple locations.
- Virtual Private Network (VPN): A secure network that uses the internet to connect remote users to a private network.
