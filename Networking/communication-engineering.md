# Communication Engineering

## DATA COMMUNICATION

Data is a collection of discrete or continuous values that:
• convey information
• describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning,or
• simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.

Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable.The effectiveness
of a data communications system depends on four fundamental characteristics: 
- delivery:The system must deliver data to the correct destination
- accuracy:The system must deliver the data accurately.
- timeliness:The system must deliver data in a timely manner.
- and jitter:Jitter refers to the variation in the packet arrival time.It is the uneven delay in the delivery of audio or video packets.


### Components

A data communications system has five components.

1. Message: The message is the information (data) to be communicated. Popular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video.
2. Sender: The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on.
3. Receiver: The receiver is the device that receives the message.
4. Transmission medium: The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver.
5. Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications.It represents an agreement between the communicating devices.

### Data Representation

**Text**
text is represented as a bit pattern, a sequence of bits (0s or 1s). Different sets of bit patterns have been designed to represent text symbols. Each set is called a code, and the process of representing symbols is called coding

**Numbers**
Numbers are also represented by bit patterns.

**Images**
Images are also represented by bit patterns.In its simplest form, an image is composed of a matrix of pixels (picture elements), where each pixel is a small dot.The size of the
pixel depends on the resolution.

**Audio**
Audio refers to the recording or broadcasting of sound or music. Audio is by nature different from text, numbers, or images.

**Video**
Video refers to the recording or broadcasting of a picture or movie.

### Data Flow
Communication between two devices can be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex

#### Simplex
In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit; the other can only receive

#### Half-Duplex
In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.


#### Full-Duplex
In full-duplex mode (also called duplex), both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.

## NETWORKS

A network is the interconnection of a set of devices capable of communication.

### Network Criteria
- Performance:Performance can be measured in many ways, including transit time and response time.Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response.
- Reliability:network reliability is measured by the frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from a failure, and the network’s robustness in a catastrophe.
- Security:Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data losses.

### Physical Structures
#### Connection Type
- Point-to-Point:A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two devices.
- Multipoint:A multipoint (also called multidrop) connection is one in which more than two specific devices share a single link.

#### Physical Topology
The term physical topology refers to the way in which a network is laid out physically.

- Mesh Topology
- Star Topology
- Bus Topology
- Ring Topology
