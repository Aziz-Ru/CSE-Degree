# Bandwidth Utilization

## MULTIPLEXING
Multiplexing is the set of techniques that allow the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link.

There are three basic multiplexing techniques: 
- frequency-division multiplexing,
- wavelength-division multiplexing,
- and time-division multiplexing.

The first two are techniques designed for analog signals, the third, for digital signals

### Frequency-Division Multiplexing
Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is an analog technique that can be applied when the bandwidth of a link (in hertz) is greater than the combined bandwidths of the signals to be transmitted.
signals generated by each sending device mod late different carrier frequencies. These modulated signals are then combined into a single composite signal that can be transported by the link
