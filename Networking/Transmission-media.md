# Transmission Media
A transmission medium can be broadly defined as anything that can carry infor- mation from a source to a destination.The transmission medium is usually free space, metallic cable,or fiber-optic cable

Classes of transmission media

1. Guided Media
     1. Twisted-pair cable
     2. Coaxial cable
     3. Fiber Optic Cable
2. Unguided
     1. Radio Wave
     2. Microwave
     3. Infrared

  ## GUIDED MEDIA
Guided media, which are those that provide a conduit from one device to another, include twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable.Twisted-pair and coaxial cable use metallic (copper) conductors that accept and transport signals in the form of electric current. Optical fiber is a cable that accepts and transports signals in the form of light.

### Twisted Pair 
A twisted pair consists of two conductors (normally copper), each with its own plastic insulation, twisted together.One of the wires is used to carry signals to the receiver, and the other is used only as a ground reference.The receiver uses the difference between the two.
