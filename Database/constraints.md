# Constraints

Constraints are restriction that are applied to database tables to ensure the integrity ,accuracy and validaty of data.

5 different types of relational constraints

- Domain constraint
- Tuple Uniqueness constraint
- Key constraint
- Entity Integrity constraint
- Referential Integrity constraint



## Domain Constraint

  Domain constraint defines the domain or set of values for an attribute.
  It specifies that the value taken by the attribute must be the atomic value from its domain.

## Tuple Uniqueness Constraint

Tuple Uniqueness constraint specifies that all the tuples must be necessarily unique in any relation.

## Key Constraint
Key constraint specifies that in any relation
    All the values of primary key must be unique.
    The value of primary key must not be null.

  ## Entity Integrity Constraint
  Entity integrity constraint specifies that no attribute of primary key must contain a null value in any relation.

  ## Referential Integrity Constraint-

 This constraint is enforced when a foreign key references the primary key of a relation.
