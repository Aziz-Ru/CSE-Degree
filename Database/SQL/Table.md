# SQL TABLE
## CREATE Table
In RDBMS, Database tables are used to store the data in the form of some structures (fields and records). Here, a field is a column defining the type of data to be stored in a table and record is a row containing actual data. In simple words, we can say a Table is a combination of rows and columns.
