## What is TLS (Transport Layer Security)?

Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). 

## What is the difference between TLS and HTTPS?

HTTPS is an implementation of TLS encryption on top of the HTTP protocol, which is used by all websites as well as some other web services. 

## What does TLS do?

There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes: Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity.

    - Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.
    - Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.
    - Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.
