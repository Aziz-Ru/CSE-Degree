## What is TLS (Transport Layer Security)?

Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). 

## What is the difference between TLS and HTTPS?

HTTPS is an implementation of TLS encryption on top of the HTTP protocol, which is used by all websites as well as some other web services. 

## What does TLS do?

There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes: Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity.

    - Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.
    - Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.
    - Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.

## How does TLS work?

A TLS connection is initiated using a sequence known as the TLS handshake. When a user navigates to a website that uses TLS, the TLS handshake begins between the user's device (also known as the client device) and the web server.

- Specify which version of TLS (TLS 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) they will use
- Decide on which cipher suites (see below) they will use
- Authenticate the identity of the server using the server's TLS certificate
- Generate session keys for encrypting messages between them after the handshake is complete

The TLS handshake establishes a cipher suite for each communication session. The cipher suite is a set of algorithms that specifies details such as which shared encryption keys, or session keys, will be used for that particular session. TLS is able to set the matching session keys over an unencrypted channel thanks to a technology known as public key cryptography.

## How does TLS affect web application performance?

The latest versions of TLS hardly impact web application performance at all.

Because of the complex process involved in setting up a TLS connection, some load time and computational power must be expended. The client and server must communicate back and forth several times before any data is transmitted, and that eats up precious milliseconds of load times for web applications, as well as some memory for both the client and the server.

However, there are technologies in place that help to mitigate potential latency created by the TLS handshake. One is TLS False Start, which lets the server and client start transmitting data before the TLS handshake is complete. Another technology to speed up TLS is TLS Session Resumption, which allows clients and servers that have previously communicated to use an abbreviated handshake.

These improvements have helped to make TLS a very fast protocol that should not noticeably affect load times. As for the computational costs associated with TLS, they are mostly negligible by todayâ€™s standards
