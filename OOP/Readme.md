## OOP


Objects are representations of real-life elements. Each object has a set of attributes
that differentiates it from the rest of the objects of the same class, and is capable of a
set of actions. A class is the definition of what an object looks like and what it can do,
like a pattern for objects.

### Public, Protected,Private

- #### Public
  
  The member is accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.For members that need to be universally accessible.

- #### Private

The member is only accessible within the class itself. It is not accessible in derived/child classes or outside the class.

- #### protected

The member is accessible within the class and its derived/child classes, but not outside the class.
