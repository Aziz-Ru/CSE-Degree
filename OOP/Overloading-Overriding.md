## Overloading & Overriding
To implement polymorphism in Java, we use two concepts method overloading and method overriding.
The method overloading is performed in the same class where we have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, whereas, the method overriding is performed by using the inheritance 
where we can have multiple methods with the same name in parent and child classes.
