## Overloading & Overriding
To implement polymorphism in Java, we use two concepts method overloading and method overriding.
### Overloading
The method overloading is performed in the same class where we have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
### Overrriding
whereas, the method overriding is performed by using the inheritance  where we can have multiple methods with the same name in parent and child classes.
