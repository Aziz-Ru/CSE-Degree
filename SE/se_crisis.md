# Software Crisis

Software Crisis is a term used in computer science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The inefficiencies in the software development process made it difficult to meet the rapidly increasing demand for computing resources and complex software.This led to what is known as the “Software Crisis” which began in the mid-1960s and lasted until the mid-1980s.
During this period, software development often ran over budget, behind schedule, and consisted of unmanageable, buggy code.

**The solution to the “Software Crisis” involved transforming unorganized coding efforts into an established engineering discipline.**

- At that time Projects were running overtime.
- At that time Software was very inefficient.
- The quality of the software was low quality.
- Software often did not meet user requirements.
- At that time Software was never delivered.
- Non-optimal resource utilization.
- Challenging to alter, debug, and enhance.
