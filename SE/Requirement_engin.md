# Requirement Engineering

A systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system is known as requirements engineering.

- Requirements Gathered
- Analyzed
- Documented
- Prioritized

### Requirement Engineering Process

Feasiblity Study -> Requirements Elicitation -> Requirements Specification -> Verifcation & Validation -> Management

**Feasiblity Study**

**Requirements elicitation** is the process of gathering information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

**Requirements specification** is the process of documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent, and unambiguous manner. 

**Requirements verification and validation** (V&V) is the process of checking that the requirements for a software system are complete, consistent, and accurate and that they meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

Verification is checking that the requirements are complete, consistent, and accurate.
Validation is the process of checking that the requirements meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

**Requirement management** is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders.

|Functional Requirements|Non Functional Requirements|
|--|---|
|These describe what the software system should do.|These describe how well the software system should do it.|
|Focuses on the behavior and features of the system. |Focuses on the performance, usability, and other quality attributes.|
|They specify the functionality that the system must provide, such as input validation, data storage, and user interface.|They specify the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, reliability, usability, and security.|
|Directly affects the business logic.|Influences user satisfaction and system efficiency.|



### Advantages

- Ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders

- Identify potential issues or problems early in the development process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant 

-  ensure that the software is developed in a cost-effective and efficient manner

- improve communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders

### Disadvantages

-  time-consuming and costly

-  difficult to ensure that all stakeholdersâ€™ needs and expectations are taken into account

- challenging to ensure that the requirements are clear, consistent, and complete

-  flexible, adaptable, and should be aligned with the overall project goals.


### Quality Characteristics of a good SRS

- Complete

- Consistent

- Unambiguous

- Verifiable

- Prioritized
