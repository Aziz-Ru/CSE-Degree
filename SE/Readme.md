# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

### Software

Software is collection of programs instruction that provide desired functionality.

### Software Engineering

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a systematic and structured approch to meet the user requirements.

#### Why is Software Engineering required
- To manage Large software
- For more Scalability
- Cost Management
- To manage the dynamic nature of software
- For better quality Management


#### Objectives of Software Engineering

**Maintainability**: It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.

**Efficiency**: The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc.

**Correctness**: A software product is correct if the different requirements specified in the SRS Document have been correctly implemented.

**Reusability**: A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.

**Testability**: Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software concerning those criteria.

**Reliability**: It is an attribute of software quality. Software has ability to perform consistently and accurately in different condition and scenarios . 

**Portability**: In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.

**Adaptability**: In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.

**Interoperability**: Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.

**Scalability**: The software can handle an increasing workload and it can easily extend to meet the changing requirements.
