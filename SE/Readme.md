# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

### Software

Software is collection of programs instruction that provide desired functionality.

### Software Engineering

Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a systematic and structured apporoch to meet the user requirements.

#### Why is Software Engineering required
- To manage Large software
- For more Scalability
- Cost Management
- To manage the dynamic nature of software
- For better quality Management


#### Objectives of Software Engineering

**Maintainability**: It should be feasible for the software to evolve to meet changing requirements.

**Efficiency**: The software should not make wasteful use of computing devices such as memory, processor cycles, etc.

**Correctness**: A software product is correct if the different requirements specified in the SRS Document have been correctly implemented.

**Reusability**: A software product has good reusability if the different modules of the product can easily be reused to develop new products.

**Testability**: Here software facilitates both the establishment of test criteria and the evaluation of the software concerning those criteria.

**Reliability**: It is an attribute of software quality. Software has ability to perform consistently and accurately in different condition and scenarios . 

**Portability**: In this case, the software can be transferred from one computer system or environment to another.

**Adaptability**: In this case, the software allows differing system constraints and the user needs to be satisfied by making changes to the software.

**Interoperability**: Capability of 2 or more functional units to process data cooperatively.

**Scalability**: The software can handle an increasing workload and it can easily extend to meet the changing requirements.

### Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high quality, maintainable software that meets the user’s requirements. 

**Phases of the SDLC**

0. Feasibility study 

The main aim of feasiblity study is to determine whether it would be possible financially and technically possible to develope the product.

1. Planning & Requirements Gathering
Requirements gathering is a important phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) and project management. It involves collecting, documenting, and managing the requirements that define the features and functionalities of a system or application.

- Stakeholder Identification : Identify all stakeholders who will be affected by the system, directly or indirectly.

- Stakeholder Analysis:Understand the needs, expectations, and influence of each stakeholder.Analyze stakeholder inputs to prioritize requirements and manage conflicting interests.

- Problem Definition:Clearly define the problems or opportunities that the software system aims to address.

- Requirements Extraction:Gather detailed requirements by interacting with stakeholders.

- Validation and Verification: Ensure that gathered requirements are accurate, complete, and consistent.

- Requirements Documentation:Document gathered requirements in a structured format.

Benifits: Cost Reduction,Customer Satisfaction,Improved Communication,Enhanced Quality,Accurate Planning

#### Functional Requirements

These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic facilities that the system should offer.

2. System Design

In the design phase, the software’s architecture and user interface are developed. This step defines how the software will work and how users will interact with it

3. Implementation (or Coding)

Implementation phase is the most important phase of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) this phase comes after design phase. Output of the design phase will be implemented in the this phase.

4. Testing

5. Maintenance

### What is Software Modeling?


Software modeling is the process of creating abstract representations of a software system. These models serve as blueprints that guide developers, designers, and stakeholders through the system’s structure, behavior, and functionality. 


### Waterfall Model

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential model which means that a development phase cannot begin unti the previous is completed.

**Advantages**

- simple and easy to understand.
- useful for small projects.
- easy to manage.
- we can move to the next phase only after the first phase is successfully completed so that there is no overlapping between the phases.

**Disadvantages**

- complete and accurate requirements are expected at the beginning of the development process
- go back to the previous phase due to which it is very difficult to change the requirements.
- high risk and uncertainty in this model.
- testing period comes very late

### Prototyping Model

Prototype model is an activity in which prototypes of software applications are created. First a prototype is created and then the final product is manufactured based on that prototype.A prototype is a toy implementation of the system.A prototype usually turns out to be a very crude version of the actual system.

**One problem in this model is that if the end users are not satisfied with the prototype model, then a new prototype model is created again, due to which this model consumes a lot of money and time.**

### Incremental Model

software requirements are divided or broken down into several stand-alone modules or increments in the SDLC 
- we collect the customer's requirements, now instead of making the entire software at once, we first take some requirements and based on them create a module or function of the software and deliver it to the customer. Then we take some more requirements and based on them add another module to that software.

- modules are added to the software in each increment until the complete system is created.

- starts by developing an initial implementation, then user feedback is taken on it, and it is developed through several versions until an accepted system is developed. 

#### Advantages
1. Important modules/functions are developed first and then the rest are added in chunks.

2. Working software is prepared quickly and early during the software development life cycle (SDLC).

3. This model is flexible and less expensive to change requirements and scope

4. The customer can respond to each module and provide feedback if any changes are needed.

5. Project progress can be measured.

6. easier to test and debug

#### Disadvantages
Management is a continuous activity that must be handled.
Before the project can be dismantled and built incrementally
The complete requirements of the software should be clear.
