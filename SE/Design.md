# Design

Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form,
which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.Software design is the first step in SDLC (Software Design Life Cycle), which moves the concentration from problem domain to solution domain.

- Transforming requirements into code.
- Breaking down requirements into sets of related modeule.
- Design communicating business rules and application login.

 The software design process can be divided into the following three levels
 
 - Architectural Design
 - high-level design
 - Detailed Design
 
 Elements of a System
 
Architecture: This is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and views of a system.The architectural design is the highest abstract version of the system.

Modules: These are components that handle one specific task in a system. 

Components: This provides a particular function or group of related functions.They are made up of modules.

Interfaces: This is the shared boundary across which the components of a system exchange information and relate.

Data: This is the management of the information and data flow.


- Detailed design
Detailed design is the specification of the internal elements of all major system components, their properties, relationships, processing, and often their algorithms and the data structures.

## Software Design Concepts

The software design concept simply means the idea or principle behind the design.

### Abstraction

 Abstraction simply means to hide the details to reduce complexity and increase efficiency or quality.
 
### Modularity

Modularity simply means dividing the system or project into smaller parts to reduce the complexity of the system or project.modularity in design means subdividing a system into smaller parts so that these parts can be created independently and then use these parts in different systems to perform different functions.

### Architecture
Architecture simply means a technique to design a structure of something.ocuses on various elements and the data of the structure.
