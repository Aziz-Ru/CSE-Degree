# Object-oriented design
Object-oriented design (OOD) is a programming technique that solves software problems by building a system of interrelated objects

### Importance of Object-Oriented Design
Modularity: OOD simplifies development and maintenance by decomposing complicated structures into smaller, more manageable components.

Reusability: Objects and classes can be reused across different projects, reducing redundancy and saving time.

Scalability: OOD facilitates system growth by making it simple to incorporate new objects without interfering with already-existing functionality.

Maintainability: Encapsulation of data and behavior within objects simplifies troubleshooting and updates, enhancing system reliability

## BASIC OBJECT-ORIENTATION CONCEPTS

- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Method overriding
- Genericity
- Composite objects

#### Encapsulation 
It is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.

#### Abstraction 
It involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.

#### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class.

#### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. 

#### Composition

Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes,

## UML Diagrams for Visualizing OOD

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual modeling language that is a versatile, flexible, and user-friendly method for visualizing a system’s design


### What is a model?
A model is an abstraction of a real problem (or situation),and is constructed by leaving out unnecessary details.This reduces the problem complexity and makes it easy to understand the problem (or situation).A model in the context of software development can be graphical, textual, mathematical,or program code-based.UML is primarily a graphical modeling
language.

The initial model of a problem is called an analysis model. The analysis
model of a problem can be reﬁned into a design model using a design methodology.

An important reason behind constructing a model is that it helps to manage the complexity in a problem and facilitates arriving at good solutions and at the same time helps to reduce the design costs.

- Analysis
- Specification
- Design
- Coding
- Visualization


### UML DIAGRAMS
UML diagrams help to capture the following five views (models) of a system

- User’s view
- Structural View
- Behavioral view
- Implementation View
- Environment View


#### User's View

The user's view capture the functionalities offered by the system to it's users.The users’ view is a black-box view of the system system to its users.
where the internal structure, the dynamic behaviour of diﬀerent system components, the implementation etc. are ignored.**he users’ view is considered as the central view and all other views are required to conform to this view.**

#### Structural view
The structural view deﬁnes the structure of the problem  in terms of the kinds of objects (classes) important to the understanding of the working of a system and to its implementation.

#### Behavioural view
The behavioural view captures how objects interact with each other in time to realise the system behaviour.

#### Implementation view
This view captures the important components of the system and their interdependencies.
