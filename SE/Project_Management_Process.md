# Project Management Process

Project Management is the discipline of planning, monitoring, and controlling software projects, identifying the scope, 
estimating the work involved, and creating a project schedule.

### Project size estimation

Project size estimation is determining the scope and resources required for the project. 

Estimation of the size of the software is an essential part of Software Project Management. It helps the project manager to further predict the effort and time
that will be needed to build the project.Here are some of the measures that are used in project size estimation:

1. Lines of Code (LOC)
   LOC counts the total number of lines of source code in a project
2. Number of Entities in ER Diagram
   ER model provides a static view of the project. It describes the entities and their relationships. The number of entities in the ER model can be used to measure the estimation of the size of the project.

3. Total Number of Processes in DFD
Data Flow Diagram(DFD) represents the functional view of software. The model depicts the main processes/functions involved in software and the flow of data between them.



## Software Metrics
A metric is a measurement of the level at which any impute belongs to a system product or process.There are 4 functions related to software metrics: 
    - Planning
    - Organizing
    - Controlling
    - Improving
