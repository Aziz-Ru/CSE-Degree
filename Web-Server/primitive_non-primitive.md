**The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types is that primitive data types are predefined and built into a programming language, while non-primitive data types are created by the programmer.** 
Here are some other differences between primitive and non-primitive data types:
Mutability
Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after assignment. Non-primitive data types are mutable, meaning their values can be changed after assignment. 
Type of data stored
Primitive data structures store single values, while non-primitive data structures store collections of data elements. 

Memory efficiency
Primitive data structures are highly memory-efficient due to their fixed size, while non-primitive data structures may be less memory-efficient due to their dynamic sizing.


Primitive Data Types:

Integer types (e.g., int in Java, number in JavaScript)
Floating-point numbers (e.g., float, double)
Character (char)
Boolean (true/false)
String (in some languages like Python, String is treated as primitive)
Non-Primitive Data Types:

Arrays
Classes/Objects
Interfaces
Enumerations
Collections (e.g., List, Set, Map)

Primitive Data Types:
Cannot hold null values directly (in most languages).

Non-Primitive Data Types:
Can hold null values since they store references.
Example: String name = null; is valid in Java.
