# Web Engineering
Web Engineering is the application of systematic and quantiﬁable approaches (concepts, methods, techniques, tools) to cost-effective requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, operation, and maintenance of high-quality Web applications.
Web Engineering is also the scientiﬁc discipline concerned with the study of these approaches.

### Web Application
Web application is a peice of software that run on server  is accessed by users through a web browser over the Internet or an intranet.

### Web servers
A web server is no more than a piece of software running on a machine and listening to requests from a specific port.

The basic principles of Web Engineering can, however, be described similarly to those of Software Engineering

• Clearly deﬁned goals and requirements
• Systematic development of a Web application in phases
• Careful planning of these phases
• Continuous audit of the entire development process.

## Categories of Web applications

### Document centric Web sites
- Document centric Web sites are the precursor to Web applications
- Web pages are stored on a Web server as ready-made, i.e. static, HTML documents and sent to the Web client in response to a request.
- These Web pages are usually updated manually using respective tools.
- The main beneﬁts are the simplicity and stability of such Web sites and the short response time, as the pages are already stored on the Web server.
- Static homepages, webcasts,and simple web presences for small businesses belong in this category.

### Interactive Web application
- Dynamically generated Web pages and links
- HTML forms, interactive Web applications emerged, offering a ﬁrst, simple, form of interactivity by means of forms, radio buttons and selection menus.
- Examples for this category are virtual exhibitions, news sites, or timetable information.

### Transactional Web applications
- provide more interactivity, giving the user the possibility of not only interacting with the application in a read-only manner, but also by performing updates on the underlying content.
- Online banking, online shopping, and booking systems belong in this category.

### Workﬂow-based Web applications
- allow the handling of workﬂows within or between different companies, public authorities, and private users
- Web services to guarantee interoperability
- The complexity of the services in question, the autonomy of the participating companies and the necessity for the workﬂows to be robust and ﬂexible are the main challenges
- Business-to-Business solutions (B2B solutions) in e-commerce, e-government applications in the area of public administration, or Web-based support of patient workﬂows in the health sector.

### Collaborative Web application
- cooperation purposes in unstructured operations (groupware). There the need for communication between the cooperating users is particularly high.
- simple chat rooms), as scheduling systems, or as e-learning platforms.

### Social Web application
• Find Related objects of interest
• Find people with similar interests
• people provide their identity to a community of others with similar interests

### Portal-oriented Web applications 
- provide a single point of access to separate, potentially heterogeneous sources of information and services


### Ubiquitous Web application
- Customized services anytime anywhere and for any device.
- Based on this dynamic adjustments according to the users’ situation
- location-aware services

### Semantic Web application
- Presenting information on the Web not only for humans, but also in a machine-readable form
- This would facilitate knowledge management on the Web, in particular the linking and reuse of knowledge
- increased interoperation on the semantic level and the possibility of automating tasks

## What Is a WebE Framework?
A framework 2 establishes the foundation for a complete Web engineering process by identifying a small number of framework activities that are applicable to all WebApp projects, regardless of their size or complexity. In addition, the framework encompasses a set of umbrella activities that are applicable across the entire WebE process.

- Communication. Involves heavy interaction and collaboration with the customer (and other stakeholders) and encompasses requirements gathering and other related activities.

- Planning, Establishes an incremental plan 3 for the WebE work. It describes the WebE actions that will occur, the technical tasks to be conducted, the risks that are likely, the resources that will be required, the work products to be produced, and a work schedule.

- Modeling. Encompasses the creation of models that assist the developer and the customer to better understand WebApp requirements and the design that will achieve those requirements.

- Construction. Combines both the generation of HTML, XML, Java, and similar code with testing that is required to uncover errors in the code.

- Deployment. Delivers a WebApp increment 4 to the customer who evaluates it and provides feedback based on the evaluation
