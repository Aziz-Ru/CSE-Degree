# Component
React Components are the building block of React Application.we mainly have two types of components.1.Functional Components 2.Class based Components.

## Functional Components
Functional components are just like JavaScript functions that accept properties and return a React element.We can create a functional component in React by writing a JavaScript function.

## Class based Components
The class components are a little more complex than the functional components. A class component can show inheritance and access data of other components.Class Component must include the line “extends React.Component” to pass data from one class component to another class component. We can use JavaScript ES6 classes to create class-based components in React.
