# React Fragment
## <Fragment>
Wrap elements in <Fragment> to group them together in situations where you need a single element. Grouping elements in Fragment has no effect on the resulting DOM; it is the same as if the elements were not grouped. The empty JSX tag <></> is shorthand for <Fragment></Fragment> in most cases.
