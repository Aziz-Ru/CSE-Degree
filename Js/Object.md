# Javascript Object

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

- Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Dates are always objects
- Maths are always objects
- Regular expressions are always objects
- Arrays are always objects
- Functions are always objects
- Objects are always objects
```
const person = {
  fname:" John",
  lname:" Doe",
  age: 25
};

```
- You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value. ` person.nationality = "English"; `
- delete keyword deletes a property from an object.`delete person.age;`
- You access an object method with the following syntax:`objectName.methodName()`
