## Features of Next.js

  - Server-side Rendering (SSR): This improves SEO and initial load performance by rendering pages on the server. Content is already available for search engines to index, and users see a fully rendered page on the first load.
  - Static Site Generation (SSG): This pre-renders pages at build time, making them super fast to load. Ideal for content that changes infrequently, like blog posts or landing pages.
  - Automatic Code Splitting: This breaks down your application code into smaller bundles, improving load times by only loading the code needed for the current page.
  - Data Fetching: Next.js offers several ways to fetch data, including getStaticProps for fetching data at build time and getServerSideProps for fetching data on each request. This flexibility allows you to choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs.
   - Routing: Routing is simplified in Next.js. It automatically creates routes based on the file structure of your pages directory, making it easy to manage your applicationâ€™s URL structure.
   - Image Optimization: Next.js automatically optimizes images, including resizing and compressing them, for faster loading times and improved SEO.
   - Built-in CSS and JavaScript Bundling: Next.js takes care of bundling and optimizing your CSS and JavaScript code, streamlining the development process.
   - API Routes: Next.js allows you to create serverless functions directly within your application using API routes. This lets you add backend functionality to your React application without needing a separate server.
