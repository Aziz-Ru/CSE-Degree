# Signals-Definition

Anything that carries information can be called as signal. It can also be defined as a physical quantity that varies with time, temperature, pressure or with any independent variables such as speech signal or video signal.

 Any unwanted signal interfering with the main signal is termed as noise. So, noise is also a signal but unwanted.
 
 ### Continuous Time Signals
Continuous-time signals are defined along a continuum of time and are thus, represented by a continuous independent variable. Continuous-time signals are often referred to as analog signals.

### Discrete Time signals

The signals, which are defined at discrete times are known as discrete signals. Therefore, every independent variable has distinct value. Thus, they are represented as sequence of numbers.

### Unit Impulse or Delta Function

A signal, which satisfies the condition, δ(t)=limϵ→∞x(t) is known as unit impulse signal. This signal tends to infinity when t = 0 and tends to zero when t ≠ 0 such that the area under its curve is always equals to one. 

### Sinusoidal Signal

A signal, which is continuous in nature is known as continuous signal. General format of a sinusoidal signal is
x(t)=Asin(ωt+ϕ)

A = amplitude of the signal

ω = Angular frequency of the signal (Measured in radians)

φ = Phase angle of the signal (Measured in radians)
