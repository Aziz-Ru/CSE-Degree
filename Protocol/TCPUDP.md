# TCP/IP Model

It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers.

## What Does TCP/IP Do?
The main work of TCP/IP is to transfer the data of a computer from one device to another. The main condition of this process is to make data reliable and accurate so that the receiver will receive the same information which is sent by the sender. To ensure that, each message reaches its final destination accurately, the TCP/IP model divides its data into packets and combines them at the other end, which helps in maintaining the accuracy of the data while transferring from one end to another end.

## What is the Difference between TCP and IP?
TCP and IP are different protocols of Computer Networks. The basic difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) is in the transmission of data. In simple words, IP finds the destination of the mail and TCP has the work to send and receive the mail. UDP is another protocol, which does not require IP to communicate with another computer. IP is required by only TCP. This is the basic difference between TCP and IP.

## How Does the TCP/IP Model Work?

Whenever we want to send something over the internet using the TCP/IP Model, the TCP/IP Model divides the data into packets at the sender’s end and the same packets have to be recombined at the receiver’s end to form the same data, and this thing happens to maintain the accuracy of the data. TCP/IP model divides the data into a 4-layer procedure, where the data first go into this layer in one order and again in reverse order to get organized in the same way at the receiver’s end.
1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer(TCP/UDP)
3. Network/Internet Layer(IP)
4. Data Link Layer (MAC)
5. Physical Layer
